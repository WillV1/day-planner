# day-planner

Day Planner is an application that utilizes JQuery and Moment.js to provide the user a dynamic day planner, allowing the user to enter to-do tasks into hourly time blocks and save the to-do's for later access.

I designed this application to demonstrate JQuery proficiency as well as proficiency to utilize client-side local storage functionality to store to-do tasks for brower persistence upon the user's brower refresh and later later retrieval.

Key Features:

Moment.js functionality to provide dynamically updated calendar date as well as dynamic color changing functionality using the colors grey (past), red (present), and green (future) that would change based on the time of day, between the business hours of 9am - 5pm.  

Bootstrap to generate the rows that would hold the hourly time blocks for data entry.

Client-side local storage to allow the changes to the time blocks to persist upon reloading of the page.
