# day-planner

In this project I combined the use of JQuery and Moment.js to create a day planner application that a busy individual could use to enter events that needed to be completed between the business hours of 9am - 5pm.  I used Moment.js to identify the current day planner date and to make the planner dynamically identify the past, present and future hours of the day, using the colors grey, red, and green that would change based on the time of day.

I used Bootstrap to generate the rows that would hold the hourly time blocks for data entry and JQuery to generate code to allow for dynamic changes to the webpage in place of vanilla Javascript.  I also utilized local storage to allow the changes to the time blocks to persist upon reloading of the page.
